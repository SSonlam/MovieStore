# MovieStore

## Implementation
Emphasized modularity by creating about 15+ classes. Used the Factory design pattern to implement polymorphism when creating Movie objects and Transaction objects. Binary tree was used as the container to hold data, this was to be able to access customers in O(Logn) time.
